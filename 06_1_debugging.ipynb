        "Python 3.7 has a built-in interctive debugger called **pdb**. It is possible to stop the execution of the code at any point by setting a breakpoint.  This will jump you into interactive the pdb command line.  From there you can then print values of variables, list lines of code, run one line of code at a time.  Taken directly from the [pdb documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html), here are the important five commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "* n(ext): Execute the current line and move to the next line. If the current line is a function call, execute the entire function and return to the next line in the calling code.\n",
        "* s(tep): Execute the current line and step into any function calls on that line. If the current line is not a function call, behave like \"n(ext)\".\n",
        "* c(ontinue): Continue executing the code until the next breakpoint is encountered.\n",
        "* p(rint): Print the value of a variable. For example, \"p x\" would print the current value of the variable \"x\".\n",
        "* q(uit): Quit the debugger and abort the program.\n",
        "* h(elp): Print a list of available commands or provide help on a specific command. For example, \"h p\" would provide help on the \"print\" command.\n",
        "* l(ist): List the code around the current line of execution.\n",
        "* q(uit): Quit the debugger and abort the program.\n",
